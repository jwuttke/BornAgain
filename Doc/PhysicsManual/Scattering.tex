This chapter provides a self-contained introduction
into the theory of neutron and X-ray scattering,
as needed for the analysis of grazing-incidence small-angle scattering (GISAS) experiments.

In \Cref{Swave},
a generic wave equation is derived.
In \Cref{SDWBA},
it is solved in first-order distorted-wave Born approximation (DWBA).

The chapter finishes with a qualitative discussion

\section{Wave propagation}\label{Swave}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\index{Wave propagation|(}%

In this section, we review the wave equations that describe the propagation
of neutrons (\cref{SnScalar,SnSpinor}) and X-rays (\cref{SXwave}) in matter,
and combine them into a unified wave equation (\cref{SuniWave})
that is the base for the all following analysis.
This provides justification and background
for Eqns.~1--3 in the BornAgain reference paper~\cite{PoVB20}.

{This is not explicitly supported in the software,

Therefore we only need to consider monochromatic waves

with given frequency~$\omega$.
\nomenclature[1ω 020]{$\omega$}{Frequency of incident radiation}%
In consequence, the wavefunction

In conclusion, the coarse-grained neutron optical potential~\cref{Evrcoarse}

In general, the incident neutron beam in a scattering experiment

To compute scattering cross sections,
\index{Cross section}%

we will only need the \E{ratio} of scattered to incident flux.
Mostly we will assume pure states to be plane waves

We replace the sum in~\cref{EdefRho} by an integral,

Since BornAgain only addresses elastic scattering,
\index{Elastic scattering}%
\index{Scattering!elastic}%
we assume the permeability and permittivity tensors $\v\mu$ and~$\v\eps$
to be time-independent.
\index{Time dependence!dielectric permittivity}%
Therefore, as in~\cref{SnScalar}, we only need to consider monochromatic waves
\index{Wave!monochromatic}%
\index{Monochromatic wave}%
with given frequency~$\omega$,
and each of the fields $\v{E}$, $\v{D}$, $\v{H}$, $\v{B}$
factorizes into a stationary field and a time-dependent phase factor.\footnote
{This phase factor can be defined with a plus or a minus sign in the exponent.
Most texts on X-ray crystallography,
including influential texts on GISAXS \cite{ReLL09},
prefer the \E{crystallographic convention} with a plus sign.
\index{Wave propagation|seealso {Sign convention}}%
\index{Convention!sign convention}%

\index{Crystallographic sign convention}%
In BornAgain, we prefer the opposite \E{quantum-mechanical convention}

for consistency with the neutron case \cref{Estationarywave},
where the minus sign is an inevitable consequence
of the standard form of the Schrödinger equation.%
\index{Sign convention!wave propagation|)}%
}
\index{Phase factor}%
We will formulate the following in terms of the electric field
\index{Electric field}%
\begin{equation}\label{EstationaryX}
  \v{E}(\r,t) = \v{E}(\r)\e^{-i\omega t}.
\end{equation}
The other three fields can be obtained from~$\v{E}$
by straightforward application of~\cref{EMaxwell}.

Since magnetic refraction or scattering is beyong the scope of BornAgain,
the relative magnetic permeability tensor is always $\v{\mu}(\r)=1$.
\index{Permeability}%
\index{Magnetic permeability}%
As customary in SAXS and GISAXS,
\index{Grazing-incidence small-angle scattering!dielectric model}%
\index{Small-angle scattering!dielectric model}%
we assume
that the dielectric properties of the material are those of a polarizable electron cloud.\footnote
{This is occasionally called the \E{Laue model}
\index{Laue model}%
 \cite{Lau31}.}
Thereby the relative dielectric permittivity tensor~$\v{\eps}$
\index{Dielectric permittivity}%
\index{Permittivity}%
becomes a scalar,
\begin{equation}
  \eps(\r)=1-\frac{4\pi r_e}{K^2}\rho(\r),
\end{equation}
\nomenclature[1ε030 2r040]{$\eps(\r)$}{Relative dielectric permittivity function}%

given by the dispersion relation
\begin{equation}
  K^2 = \mu_0\eps_0\omega^2.
\end{equation}
\index{Dispersion!X-ray}%

With these simplifying assumptions about $\v{\eps}$ and~$\v{\mu}$,
Maxwell's equations yield the wave equation
\begin{equation}\label{ENabCrossNabE}
  \Nabla\times\Nabla\times\v{E} = K^2\eps(\r)\v{E}.
\end{equation}
\index{Wave equation!X-ray}%
\index{X-ray!wave equation}%
Using a standard identity from vector analysis, it can be brought into the more tractable form
\Emph{
\begin{equation}\label{ENabNabE}
  \left\{\Nabla^2-\Nabla\cdot\Nabla+ K^2\eps(\r)\right\}\v{E}(\r)=0.
\end{equation}
\vspace*{-5pt}}

It is well known that the electromagnetic energy flux is given by the Poynting vector.
\index{Poynting vector}%
\index{X-ray!flux}%
\index{Flux!X-rays}%
However, its standard definition, $\v{S}\coloneqq\v{E}\times\v{H}$,
is not applicable here because it only holds for \E{real} fields.
With our complex notation, it must be replaced by
\begin{equation}
  \v{S}\coloneqq \Re\v E(\r,t)\times\Re\v H(\r,t).
\end{equation}
\nomenclature[2s150]{$\v S$}{Poyinting vector}%
For stationary oscillations~\cref{EstationaryX},
the time average is
\begin{equation}
  \braket{\v S} = \frac{1}{4}\braket{\v E(\r) \times \v H(\r)^* + \text{c.~c.}}.
\end{equation}
\nomenclature[2c000 2c000]{$\text{c.~c.}$}{Complex conjugate}%
We specialize to vacuum with $\TENS\mu(\r)=1$ and $\TENS\eps(\r)=1$,
and obtain
\begin{equation}
  \braket{\v S}
  = \frac{1}{4i\omega\mu_0}
    \left( \v E^*(\r)\times\left(\Nabla\times\v{E}(\r)\right) + \text{c.~c.} \right).
\end{equation}
For a plane wave $\v E(\r)=\v E_\k \e^{i\k\r}$, we find
\begin{equation}
  \braket{\v S}
  = \frac{1}{2\omega\mu_0} |\v E_\k|^2 \Re \k,
\end{equation}
which confirms the common knowledge that the radiation intensity
counted in a detector is proportional to the squared electric field amplitude.

\section{Distorted-wave Born approximation}\label{SDWBA}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

To describe scattering from a condensed-matter sample,
\index{Scattering!target|see{Sample}}%
\index{Target|see{Sample}}%
\index{Sample}%
the wave equation is solved through a perturbation expansion.
The ordinary form of this expansion, the \E{Born approximation} (BA),
\index{BA|see{Born approximation}}%
\index{Born approximation}%
is derived in many textbooks.\footnote
{For a particularly detailed derivation
see Schober's lecture notes on neutron scattering~\cite{Sch14}.}
%E.~g.\ \cite{} for neutrons;
%\cite[Sect 9.7]{Jac75} for electromagnetic radiation}
For scattering under grazing-incidence,
\index{Grazing-incidence small-angle scattering}%
however, the more generic
\index{Distorted-wave Born approximation}%
\E{distorted-wave Born approximation} (DWBA)\footnote
{The DWBA was originally devised by Massey and Mott (ca 1933)
for collisions of charged particles.
Summaries can be found in some quantum mechanics textbooks (Messiah, Schiff)
and in monographs on scattering theory (e.~g.\ Newton).
The first explicit applications to grazing-incidence scattering
were published in 1982:
Vineyard \cite{Vin82} discussed X-ray scattering,
but failed to account for the distortion of the scattered wave;
Mazur and Mills \cite{MaMi82} deployed heavy formalism
to compute the inelastic neutron scattering cross section
of ferromagnetic surface spin waves from scratch.
A concise derivation of the DWBA cross section
was provided by Dietrich and Wagner (1984/85)
for X-rays \cite{DiWa84} and neutrons \cite{DiWa85}.
Unfortunately, their work was overlooked in much of the later literature,
which often fell back to less convincing derivations.}
is required.
In this section, we provide a self-contained derivation
based on the unified neutron and X-ray wave equation~\cref{EWAVE}.

%===============================================================================
\subsection{Distortion versus perturbation}\label{Sdecompose}
%===============================================================================

To get started,
we decompose the potential \cref{ETV}
into a more regular and a more fluctuating part:
\begin{equation}\label{Edecompose}
  \TV(\r) \eqqcolon \TL(\r) + \TU(\r).
\end{equation}
The \E{distortion field}~$\TL$
\index{Distortion field}%
\nomenclature[1λ170 2r040]{$\TL(\r)$}{Distortion field}%
comprises regular, well-known features of the sample.
The \E{perturbation potential}~$\TU$
\index{Perturbation potential}%
\index{Potential!perturbation}%
\nomenclature[2u170 2r040]{$\TU(\r)$}{Perturbation potential}%
stands for the more irregular, unknown features of the sample
one ultimately wants to study in a scattering experiment.
This is vague,
and in certain situations the decomposition~\cref{Edecompose} is indeed
to some extent arbitrary.
However, in most practical cases $\TL$ and $\TU$ are clearly determined by
the following basic idea of DWBA:

The wave equation~\cref{EWAVE} shall henceforth be written as
\Emph{
\begin{equation}\label{EDPsi}
  \TD(\r)\v\Psi(\r) = 4\pi\TENS{U}(\r)

The solution of the wave equation~\cref{EDPsi}

It is important to distinguish the \E{incident} from the \E{exciting} wave.
\index{Exciting wave}%
\index{Wave!exciting}%
They coincide in ordinary Born approximation, but not in DWBA.
\index{Born approximation}%,

The \E{exciting wave}
is prepared far
outside the sample by a radiation source and some optical devices.
\index{Radiation source}%
It is a superposition of plane waves,
as discussed later in the context of instrumental resolution effects
(\cref{SInstr}).
While discussing scattering theory,
it is usually represented by a single plane wave
$\v\Psi_\se(\r)=\e^{i\k_\se\r}$.
\nomenclature[1ψ134 2e000]{$\v\Psi_\se(\r)$}{Exciting wave}%
This function is defined for all~$\r$,
but is physical only along the primary beam, upstream of the sample.

The \E{incident wave}~$\v\Psi_\si$
\index{Incident wave!DWBA}%
\index{Incident wave!vs exciting wave}%
\index{Wave!incident}%
is an exact solution of~\cref{EDPsi0}
under the boundary condition that it must match~$\v\Psi_\se$
upstream of the sample.
Inside the sample it undergoes refraction and reflection
or other modifications under the influence of the distortion field~$\TL$.

A formal solution of the wave equation~\cref{EDPsi} is provided
by the \E{Lippmann-Schwinger equation}
\index{Lippmann-Schwinger equation}%
\begin{equation}\label{EPsiLS}
  \v\Psi(\r)
  = \v\Psi_\si(\r)
  + \int\!\d^3r'\, \TG(\r,\r') \TU(\r')\v\Psi(\r').
\end{equation}
It involves the Green function~$\TG$,
\index{Green function}%
\nomenclature[2g170 2r020 2r021]{$\TG(\r,\r')$}{Generic (possibly tensorial) Green function}%
which must fulfill
\begin{equation}\label{EGREEN}
  \TD(\r)\v\TG(\r,\r') = \ONE \delta(\r-\r') \eqqcolon \Td(\r-\r').
\end{equation}
To see that the Lippmann-Schwinger equation solves indeed the perturbed wave equation~\cref{EDPsi},
operate on both sides of~\cref{EPsiLS} with~$\TD(\r)$.
The Lippmann-Schwinger equation can be resolved into an infinite series
by iteratively substituting the full right-hand side of~\cref{EPsiLS}
for the occurence of~$\v\Psi$ in the integrand.
\index{Perturbation expansion}%
\index{Born!expansion (or series)}%
This is the \E{Born expansion} or \E{Born series}.\footnote
{Named after Max Born who introduced it in quantum mechanics.
It is actually due to Lord Rayleigh who devised it for sound,
and later also applied it to electromagnetic waves,
which resulted in his famous explanation of the blue sky.}
Successive terms in this series contain rising powers of $\TU$.
As long as $\TU$ is a small perturbation, the series converges quickly.
In \E{first-order Born approximation},
\index{Born approximation}%
only the linear order in $\TU$ is retained,
\begin{equation}\label{EBorn}
  \v\Psi(\r)
  = \v\Psi_\si(\r)
  + \int\!\d^3r'\, \TG(\r,\r') \TU(\r')\v\Psi_\si(\r').
\end{equation}
This is the base for material investigations with X-rays or neutrons,
where sample structures that modulate the perturbation potential $\TU$
are deduced from the scattered intensity ${|\v\Psi(\r)|}^2$.
Since detectors are always placed at positions $\r$
that are not illuminated by the incident beam,
we are only interested in the scattered wave
\index{Scattered radiation!Born approximation}%
\index{Wave!scattered}%
\Emph{
\begin{equation}\label{EBornS}

For brevity and mathematical convenience,
the integral has no bounds
and therefore formally runs over the entire space.
However, $\TU(\r')$ is nonzero only if $\r'$ lies inside the finite sample volume.

%===============================================================================
\subsection{Far-field Green function}\label{SDWGreen}
%===============================================================================

In experiments, scattered radiation is measured
at a detector position~$\r$ so far outside the sample
that the distance from the sample to the detector
is must be much larger than the size of the sample.
This is just the condition for \E{Fraunhofer diffraction};
\index{Fraunhofer approximation}%
In scattering theory,
it is known as the \E{far-field approximation}.
\index{Far-field approximation}%
We choose the coordinate origin
\index{Coordinate system!origin}%
\index{Origin!coordinate system}%
inside the sample so that the far-field asymptote corresponds to the limit $r\to\infty$.
To determine the far-field asymptote $\v\Psi_\text{s}^\infty(\r)$
of the scattered wave~$\v\Psi_\text{s}$ from~\cref{EBornS},
\index{Scattered radiation!far field}
it is sufficient to solve~\cref{EGREEN} for the far-field Green function

In deriving~$\TG^\infty$, it is preferable to work with well-defined
\E{polarization states}.
\index{Polarization!state}%
For either neutron spinors or electric fields,
the scattered field amplitude in vacuum
can be written as sum over two orthogonal states~$\alpha$
\nomenclature[1α010]{$\alpha$}{Polarization state index}%
with unit amplitudes~$\ue_\alpha$:
\nomenclature[2u041]{$\ue$}{Polarized field amplitude unit vector}%
\begin{equation}
   \v\Psi_\text{s}(\r)

\end{equation}
with
\begin{equation}
  \psi_\text{s}^\alpha(\r)
  \coloneqq \ue_\alpha^* \v\Psi_\text{s}(\r).
\end{equation}
Similarly, we introduce the vectorial Green function with final polarization state~$\alpha$,
\begin{equation}
   \v{G}^\alpha(\r,\r')
   \coloneqq \ue_\alpha^* \TG(\r,\r').
\end{equation}
In the far-field limit, it is given by\footnote
{To our knowledge,
the simple expression \cref{EmyG} has never before been stated.
Informations about similar results anywhere in the literature would be highly welcome.}
\Emph{
\begin{equation}\label{EmyG}
  \v{G}^\infty_\alpha(\r,\r') = \phi(r) \v\Psi_\alpha^*(\r'),
\end{equation}
\vspace*{-5pt}}
where $\phi$ is an outgoing spherical wave with
\begin{equation}\label{Effphidef}
  \phi(r) \coloneqq \frac{\e^{iKr}}{4\pi r},
\end{equation}
and $\v\Psi_\alpha$ is a solution of the unperturbed distorted wave equation
\begin{equation}
  \TD(\r)\v\Psi_\alpha(\r) = 0
\end{equation}
with the boundary condition
\begin{equation}
  \v\Psi_\alpha(\r) = \ue_\alpha\e^{i\k_\sf\r}
\end{equation}
for $r\to\infty$ and
with an outgoing wavevector
\nomenclature[2f000]{f}{Subscript ``final''}%
$\k_\sf\coloneqq K \r / r$.

We now outline a proof for~\cref{EmyG}.
We take for granted that Green functions obye \E{source-detector reciprocity} \cite{Pot04},
\begin{equation}
  \TG(\r,\r') = \TG(\r',\r).
\end{equation}
We first consider wave propagation in vacuum,
denoted by an overset circle.
Exact Green functions
are known.
The far-field must be taken explicitly,
and in all cases
\begin{equation}
  \vGo_\alpha^\infty(\r,\r') = \phi(r)\Psio_\alpha^*(\r')
\end{equation}
is obtained.
Following Dietrich and Wagner \cite{DiWa84,DiWa85,DiWa16},
we write Lippmann-Schwinger equations for a distorted wave
\begin{equation}\label{ELS2Psi}
   \Psio_\alpha(\r)
   = \int\!\d^3r''\, \left( \delta(\r-\r'') + \vGo_\alpha(\r,\r'')4\pi\TL(\r'') \right)
                     \v\Psi_\alpha(\r''),
\end{equation}
and for the Green function
\begin{equation}\label{ELS2G}
   \vGo_\alpha(\r,\r')
   = \int\!\d^3r''\, \left( \delta(\r-\r'') + \vGo_\alpha(\r,\r'')4\pi\TL(\r'') \right)
                     \v{G}_\alpha(\r'',\r').
\end{equation}
Operate on both sides with~$\TDo(\r)$ to verify that
\begin{equation}
  \TDo(\r)\TGo(\r,\r') = \Td(\r-\r') \text{ and } \TDo(\r)\Psio(r)=0
\end{equation}
imply
\begin{equation}
  \TD(\r)\TG(\r,\r') = \Td(\r-\r') \text{ and } \TD(\r)\v\Psi(r)=0.
\end{equation}
To continue, use the reciprocity of the Green function,
and take the far-field limit to transform~\cref{ELS2G} into
\begin{equation}\label{ELS2G2}
   \phi(r')\Psio_\alpha^*(\r)
   = \int\!\d^3r''\, \left( \delta(\r-\r'') + \vGo_\alpha(\r,\r'')4\pi\TL(\r'') \right)
                     \v{G}_\alpha^\infty(\r',\r'').
\end{equation}
Take the complex conjugate of~\cref{ELS2Psi},
multiply with~$\phi(r')$, and compare with \cref{ELS2G2}
to read off
\begin{equation}
   \v{G}_\alpha^\infty(\r',\r'') = \phi(r')\v\Psi_\alpha(\r''),
\end{equation}
which is~\cref{EmyG}.

\subsection{Reciprocity of the Green function}\label{SReci}
%===============================================================================

\index{Reciprocity|(}%
\index{Green function!reciprocity|(}%

Our computation of~$G_\infty$ will be based on a source-detector \E{reciprocity theorem}
for the scalar Schrödinger equation.\footnote
{There exists a confusing multitude of reciprocity theorems \cite{Pot04}.
In the end, we found it simpler to provide a derivation taylored for our application case
than to refer to the literature.}
The theorem states:
Any Green function $G(\r,\r')$
that solves~\cref{EGREEN} and as function of~$\r$ represents an outgoing wave
%(in accord with the Sommerfeld radiation condition)
%\index{Sommerfeld radiation condition}%
is invariant under an exchange of source location~$\rS$ and detection point~$\rD$:
\nomenclature[2r041 2d100]{$\rD$}{Position of detector}%
\nomenclature[2r041 2s100]{$\rD$}{Position of source, locus of scattering}%
\begin{equation}\label{Erecip}
  G(\rS,\rD) = G(\rD,\rS).
\end{equation}
Readers not interested in mathematical details may skip the following \E{proof}:

We introduce the auxiliary vector field
\begin{equation}
  \v{X}(\r,\rS,\rD)\coloneqq G(\r,\rD)\Nabla G(\r,\rS) - G(\r,\rS)\Nabla G(\r,\rD).
\end{equation}
%\nomenclature[2x150 2r040]{$\v{X}(\r,\rS,\rD)$}{Auxiliary vector field}%
We inscribe the sample and the detector
into a sphere $\Sphere$ around the coordinate origin with radius~$R$,
%\nomenclature[2s180]{$\Sphere$}{Auxiliary spherical volume}%
%\nomenclature[2r120]{$R$}{Radius of $\Sphere$}%
and compute the volume integral
\begin{equation}\label{Eprerecipro}
    I(\rS,\rD) \coloneqq \displaystyle\int_\Sphere\!\d^3r\,\Nabla \v{X}(\r,\rS,\rD).
\end{equation}
After a few steps, not entirely trivial, but not too difficult either,
we obtain
\begin{equation}\label{EIBD}
  I(\rS,\rD) = G(\rS,\rD) - G(\rD,\rS).
\end{equation}
Alternatively, we can compute $I$ as a surface integral
\begin{equation}
  I(\rS,\rD)
  =\displaystyle\int_{\partial\Sphere}\d\v{\sigma}\,\v{X}(\r,\rS,\rD).
\end{equation}
On the surface $\partial\Sphere$,
$G$ is an outgoing solution of the Helmholtz equation.
As such, it has a well-known series expansion in spherical coordinates.
We send $R\to\infty$ so that we need only to retain the lowest order:
\begin{align}
   G(\r(R,\vartheta,\varphi),\rD)
   &\doteq\displaystyle \frac{\e^{iKR}}{4\pi R} a(\vartheta,\varphi),
   \\[3.8ex]
   G(\r(R,\vartheta,\varphi),\rS)
   &\doteq\displaystyle \frac{\e^{iKR}}{4\pi R} b(\vartheta,\varphi).
\end{align}
The factorization of $G$ and $B$ and their common $R$ dependence imply that
\begin{equation}
  I(\rS,\rD)
  =\displaystyle\int_{\partial\Sphere}\d\sigma\,
       (\text{$R$-dependent})(ab-ba)
  = 0.
\end{equation}
Comparison with \cref{EIBD} yields \cref{Erecip},
which completes the proof.

\section{Coherent vs incoherent scattering}\label{Scoherlen}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%===============================================================================
\subsection{Coherence length}
%===============================================================================

Per \cref{Exsection} and~\cref{Etrama},
\index{Coherence length|(}%
the matrix element $\braket{\psi_\si|\delta v|\psi_\sf}$
is given by a three-dimensional integral
\begin{equation}\label{Etrama3}
  \braket{\psi_\si|\delta v|\psi_\sf}
  \coloneqq  \int\!\d^3r\, \psi^{*}_\si(\r)\delta v(\r)\psi_\sf(\r).
\end{equation}
The integration domain is effectively limited to a finite $z$ interval,
where $\delta v(\r)$ is nonzero.
The horizontal integration domain, however, is infinite
within our formalism,
which is of course an idealization.
Obviously, physical integration limits are imposed by the finite
\index{Sample area}%
\E{illuminated sample area}.\footnote
{We assume a well aligned instrument,
for which the beam footprint and the backtracked detector footprint
\index{Illumination!beam footprint on sample}%
\index{Beam footprint}%
\index{Backtracking!beam footprint}%
agree within reasonable accuracy.}
Another limitation comes from the finite \E{coherence length}
of the instrumental setup,
which usually is much shorter than the sample width and length
%This is of importance in neutron scattering
%where typical sample dimensions of 1\ldots10~mm
%are much larger than the relevant coherence length,
%which is of the order 10\ldots100~$\upmu$m
\cite{HaPR10,MaMM14}.\footnote
{These two references also make clear that
  the theoretical description and the experimental determination of
  coherence lengths are difficult problems and subject of ongoing research.}

While each single neutron is described by a wavefunction
that allows for \E{coherent} superposition of
different contributions to the scattered wavefunction,
the final detector statistics
\index{Detector!statistics}%
is given by an \E{incoherent} sum
over the differential cross sections of individual neutrons.
The finite \E{resolution}
\index{Resolution|(}%
of an experimental setup is in part due to the fact that
different neutrons have different wavenumbers,
originate\footnote
{It is reasonable to take the last collision in the moderator
  as the \E{origin} of a neutron ray,
  since collisions between neutrons and hydrogen nuclei bound in
  disordered matter lead to almost perfect decoherence.}
at different points in the moderator,
and are detected at slightly different points within one detector pixel.
This can be modeled by computing expected scattering intensities as
averages over different neutrons with
$K$, $\v{\hat k}_\si$, and $\v{\hat k}_\sf$ drawn at random
from appropriate distributions.
% TODO RESTORE TEMPORARILY REMOVED XREF as described in \cref{Sresolution}.

However, this is not the full story.
In the above introduction to the Born approximation
we have made the standard assumption
that an incoming neutron can be described by a plane wave
$\psi_\si=\e^{i\k_\si\r}$.
The wavefunction $\psi_\sf$ traced back from the detector is also
approximated by a plane wave.
In the DWBA we allow these waves to be distorted within the sample,
but when impinging on the sample they still are plane.
A plane wave obviously is an idealized concept,
since it has infinite lateral extension.
The \E{transverse coherence length} indicates the scale
beyond which this approximation becomes invalid.
At larger scales, the wave fronts appear randomly distorted.
Physical causes of these distortions include
reflections in the neutron guide,
diffraction by guide windows and other slits,
and diffraction by imperfect monochromator crystals.
Of course the distorted wave still admits a Fourier decomposition
into plane waves with slightly different wavevectors.
In practice, it is impossible to distinguish this spread of wavevectors
from the incoherent spread described in the previous paragraph.
The instrumental resolution function therefore
accounts for both causes of wavevector distortion.
\index{Resolution|)}%

Usually, therefore, a GISANS image is an incoherent average
over coherent diffraction patterns collected from
many small subareas of the sample.
Only horizontal sample structures on scales smaller the coherence length
yield interference patterns.
Structure fluctuations on larger scales
produce said incoherent average of different GISANS images.

The crossover from coherent to incoherent scattering is of course
a gradual one.
The coherence length indicates where a certain, somewhat arbitrary degree
of decoherence is reached.
Under these reservations
one defines a \E{coherence spot}
in the cross section of an approximately plane wave
as an area where the coherence is above a certain threshold.
Unless the wave has been prepared in a highly anisotropic guide and slit system,
this spot is about circular.
Under grazing incidence conditions however,
the projection of this spot onto the sample surface
yields a very elongated ellipse.
Therefore, the coherence length is much larger in $x$ than
in $y$ or $z$ direction.\footnote
{This has nothing to do with the distinction of
  \E{transverse} and \E{longitudinal} coherence length.
  Longitudinal coherence has to do with wavelength stability
  and is of no importance for elastic scattering.
  We are talking here about \E{horizontal} and \E{vertical}
  projections of the \E{transverse} coherence length.}

The Green function of the inhomogeneous Helmholtz equation~\cref{EGreenK}

{Verification under the condition $\r\ne0$
is a straightforward exercise in vector analysis.
For the special case $\r=0$,
one encloses the origin in a small sphere

This explains the appearance of the factor $4\pi$.}

Read as a function of~$\r$, it is an outgoing spherical wave centered at $\r'$.
To compute the far-field limit~\cref{EGinftydef},
we expand for $\r'$ with $r'\ll r$:
\begin{equation}
  \left|\r-\r'\right|
  \doteq \sqrt{r^2-2\r\,\r'}
  \doteq r - \frac{\r\,\r'}{r}
  \equiv r - \frac{\k_\sf \r'}{K},

\nomenclature[2f000]{f}{Subscript ``final''}%
where we have introduced the outgoing wavevector
$  \k_\sf\coloneqq K \r / r$.
We apply this to~\cref{EGreens1},

and obtain in leading order the far-field Green function
\begin{equation}%\label{EGreenFar}
  G_\infty(\r,\r')
  = \frac{\e^{iKr}}{4\pi r}\psi^*_\sf(\r'),

As function of~$\r$, $G_\infty$ is an outgoing spherical wave.

we obtain the far-field approximation for the scattered wave,

The differential cross section
is defined as in \cref{Exsectiondef},
namely as the ratio of scattered flux through the unit sphere to incident flux.
\index{Born approximation!elastic scattering cross section}%
\index{Cross section!Born approximation}%
\index{Scattering!cross section}%
For electromagnetic waves in vacuum, the flux is proportional to~$|\v{E}|^2$.
So the X-ray scattering cross section for given incoming and detected polarization is
\begin{equation}%\label{ExsectionXlong}
  \xElas
  =  \frac{ {\left|\braket{\Ei|\delta v|\Ef}\right|}^2 }{|\v{e}_\si|^2\,|\v{e}_\sf|^2}
\end{equation}
with the scattering matrix element
\index{Scattering!matrix}%
\Emph{
\begin{equation}%\label{EtramaE}
  \braket{\Ei|\delta v|\Ef}
  \coloneqq  \int\!\d^3r\, \Eic(\r)\delta v(\r)\Ef(\r).
\end{equation}\vspace*{-5pt}}
For lighter notation,
it is convenient to choose the vacuum plane waves \cref{EEoi,EEof} from the onset
with normalized polarization vectors,
\begin{equation}%\label{EbcE}
  \Eo_\si(r) = \hei\, \e^{i\k_\si\r}, \text{~and~}
  \Eo_\sf(r) = \hef\, \e^{i\k_\sf\r},
\end{equation}
so that~\cref{ExsectionXlong}
takes the simple form
\begin{equation}%\label{ExsectionX}
  \xElas
  =  {\left|\braket{\Ei|\delta v|\Ef}\right|}^2
\end{equation}
in full analogy with~\cref{Exsection}.
Typically, scattered radiation is detected without polarization analysis.
\index{Polarization!analysis}%
\index{Scattered radiation!detection}%
\index{Scattered radiation!polarization}%
\index{Detector!polarization}%
Then the measured cross section is an incoherent sum
\index{Incoherent sum!polarization}%
\index{Polarization!incoherent sum}%
\index{Born approximation!elastic scattering cross section}%
\index{Cross section!Born approximation}%
\index{Scattering!cross section}%
\Emph{
\begin{equation}%\label{ExsectionXsum}
  \xElas
  =  \sum_{\hef} {\left|\braket{\Ei|\delta v|\Ef}\right|}^2.
\end{equation}\vspace*{-5pt}}
In this equation,
the dependence of $\Ef$ on $\hef$ is implicit,
mediated through the boundary condition
that $\Ef(\r)$ must match $\Eo_\sf(\r)$ at the detector.
If the incident radiation is not fully polarized,
\index{Polarization!incident}%
an additional summation is performed over~$\hei$,
weighted with relative intensities.
