\chapter{Online documentation}
  \label{sec:online}

This User Manual is complementary to the online documentation
at the project web site \url{http://www.bornagainproject.org}.
It does not duplicate information that is more conveniently
read online.
This brief chapter contains no more than a few pointers to the web site.
