\chapter{Sample}\label{SRefSam}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Multilayer}\label{SRefMuLay}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Samples in BornAgain are always of type \ttIdx{MultiLayer}.

\setCpp
\begin{lstlisting}
class MultiLayer {
    MultiLayer();
    void addLayer(const Layer& p_child);
    void addLayerWithTopRoughness(const Layer& layer, const LayerRoughness& roughness);
};
\end{lstlisting}

A \texttt{MultiLayer} consists of one or more layers,
numbered from top to bottom as shown in~\cref{Fdefz}.
The function \clFct{MultiLayer}{addLayer} or \clFct{MultiLayer}{addLayerWithTopRoughness}
inserts one \ttIdx{Layer} at the high-index, low-$z$ end.

The \texttt{Layer} API is documented in~\cref{SRefLayer},
the \ttIdx{LayerRoughness} in~\cref{SRefRough}.

The following Python code fragment constructs an absolutely minimal sample:

\setPy
\begin{lstlisting}
sample = MultiLayer()
sample.addLayer(air_layer)
\end{lstlisting}

This sample just consists of an infinite volume of air.
As such, it is completely inert; it causes neither refraction, nor scattering.
However, the air layer can be \E{decorated} with a \ttIdx{ParticleLayout},
which then causes small-angle scattering,
as demostrated in the tutorial \tuto{51}{Cylinders in Born Approximation}.

The following sample consists of two half-infinite layers,
substrate under air:

\setPy
\begin{lstlisting}
sample = MultiLayer()
sample.addLayer(air_layer)
sample.addLayer(substrate_layer)
\end{lstlisting}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Layer}\label{SRefLayer}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

A \ttIdx{Layer} is constructed through the following API:

\setCpp
\begin{lstlisting}
class Layer {
    Layer();
    Layer(const IMaterial& material, double thickness=0);
    void setThickness(double thickness);
    void setMaterial(const IMaterial& material);
    void addLayout(const ParticleLayout& decoration);
};
\end{lstlisting}

It is obligatory to set a \E{material} (\cref{SRefMat}).

The \E{thickness} must be nonnegative.
The semi-infinite top and bottom layer must have a \E{pro forma} thickness of~0.
All other layers should have a thickness larger than~0.

The \texttt{Layer} can be \E{decorated} with any number of \ttIdx{ParticleLayout}s.\footnote
{The source code only requires the particle decoration to be of type \ttIdx{ILayout}.
However, since this interface is realized by no other class besides \ttIdx{ParticleLayout},
we here spell out \texttt{ILayout} as \texttt{ParticleLayout}.}
Scattering from different layouts adds incoherently.

\section{Material}\label{SRefMat}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Material classes all inherit from the pure virtual interface class \ttIdx{IMaterial}.
Currently, BornAgain only supports homogeneous materials.
They can be either nonmagnetic or magnetic.
A nonmagnetic \ttIdx{HomogeneousMaterial} is created through the API

\setCpp
\begin{lstlisting}
class HomogeneousMaterial {
    HomogeneousMaterial(const std::string &name, const complex_t refractive_index);
    HomogeneousMaterial(const std::string &name, double refractive_index_delta, double refractive_index_beta);
};
\end{lstlisting}

The second form of the constructor computes the complex refractive index
\index{Refractive index!HomogeneousMaterial@\Code{HomogeneousMaterial}}%
from the two real parameters $\delta$ and~$\beta$ according to~\cref{Endb1}.

Typical usage is:

\setPy
\begin{lstlisting}
m_air = HomogeneousMaterial("Air", 0.0, 0.0)
m_substrate = HomogeneousMaterial("Substrate", 6e-6, 2e-8)
m_particle = HomogeneousMaterial("Particle", 6e-4, 2e-8)
\end{lstlisting}

A \ttIdx{HomogeneousMagneticMaterial} has the \E{magnetic field} (in units of Tesla)
\index{Magnetic field}%
as additional parameter:

\setCpp
\begin{lstlisting}
class HomogeneousMagneticMaterial {
    HomogeneousMagneticMaterial(const std::string &name, const complex_t refractive_index, const kvector_t magnetic_field);
    HomogeneousMagneticMaterial(const std::string &name, double refractive_index_delta, double refractive_index_beta, const kvector_t magnetic_field);
    void setMagneticField(const kvector_t magnetic_field);
}
\end{lstlisting}
