In many important GISAS applications,
fluctuations of the refractive index are due to
\E{droplets}, \E{islands}, \E{inclusions} or \E{holes}

of a mesoscopic size (nanometer to micrometer).
In the following, all such inhomogeneities will be described as
\E{particles} that are embedded in a material layer.
In BornAgain, a sample can be decorated with an arbitrary number
of different particles species.
For readability, in the following
only \E{one} kind of embedded particles will be considered;
the generalization to several species is straightforward.

The matrix material has a SLD~$v_\sm(z)$
that may or may not vary with~$z$.
The SLD of the entire sample,
consisting of the matrix and an assembly of particles of type~$\sp$,
shall be written
\begin{equation}\label{Evmpr}
  v(\r) = v_\sm(z) + \Delta v_\sp(\r).
\end{equation}
If the particles are homogeneous, then
\begin{equation}\label{EDvpHomo}
  \Delta v_\sp(\r) = \left(v_\sp-v_\sm(z)\right)\chi_\sp(\r)
\end{equation}
with the indicator function
\begin{equation}\label{EdefChiP}
  \chi_\sp(\r)\coloneqq\left\{\begin{array}{ll}
  1&\text{~if $\r$ in p,}\\[.2ex]
  0&\text{~otherwise.} \end{array}\right.
\end{equation}
\nomenclature[1χ032 2p000]{$\chi_\sp(\r)$}{indicates whether $\r$ is in particle of type~$\sp$}%
\index{Indicator function}%
The following formalism, however, shall not rely on \cref{EDvpHomo},
but also allow for soft particles for which $\Delta v_\sp(\r)$ is a continuous function of~$\r$.
\Warn{Currently,
BornAgain uses the given $v_\sp$
(given through a particle refractive index)
in place of the difference $v_\sp - v_\sm(z)$.
In other words, BornAgain does not subtract the matrix SLD from the particle SLD;
it leaves it to the user to do this subtraction before entering the particle refractive index.}

The sum~\cref{Evmpr} has the same form as the decomposition~\cref{Edecompose_vz}.
Nonetheless, implementations are free to choose a convenient mean SLD~$\mv(z)$.
Currently, BornAgain uses $\mv(z)\coloneqq v_\sm(z)$,
though we suspect that for non-dilute particles
$\mv(z)\coloneqq v_\sm(z) + \overline{\Delta v_\sp(\r)}$ would yield
a more accurate scattering simulation.
With $\mv(z)\coloneqq v_\sm(z)$, we have
$\delta v_l(\r) = \Delta v_\sp(\r)$.
Outside the layer that contains the embedded particles,
$\delta v_l(\r)=0$.

With the factorization~\cref{Ekpar},
the scattering matrix element~\cref{Etrama} becomes
\begin{equation}\label{Escamatrix2}
  \bra\psi_\si|\delta v|\psi_\sf\ket
  = \int\!\d^2 r_\plll\, \e^{i\q_\plll \r_\plll}
    \int\!\d z\, \phi^*_\si(z) \delta v(\r) \phi_\sf(z).
\end{equation}
The SLD distribution of a set of identical particles,
located at positions~$\R_j$, can be written as a sum
\begin{equation}\label{Echihomo}
  v_\sp(\r) = \sum_j F(\r-\R_j).
\end{equation}
In many applications,
particles are not all identical.
They may vary in shape, size, orientation, or refractive index profile.
These degrees of freedom
shall be denoted by a parameter vector~$\v{T}_j$.
Specifically for a $2+1$~dimensional sample,
it is convenient to restrict the coordinate vectors~$\R_j$ to the $xy$~plane,
and to redefine~$\v{T}_j$ to include the vertical particle component of~$\R_j$.
In consequence, \cref{Echihomo}~is replaced by
\begin{equation}\label{Echihetero}
  v_\sp(\r) = \sum_j F(\r-\R_{j\plll},\v{T}_j).
\end{equation}
With the \E{DWBA form factor}
\begin{equation}\label{EcFdef}
  \FD_{\si\sf}(\q_\plll,\v{T})
  \coloneqq
    \int\!\d^2 r_\plll\, \e^{i\q_\plll \r_\plll}
    \int\!\d z\, \phi^*_\si(z) F(\r,\v{T}) \phi_\sf(z),
\end{equation}
the scattering matrix element~\cref{Escamatrix2} becomes
\begin{equation}\label{EsumRF}
  \bra\psi_\si|\delta v|\psi_\sf\ket
  = \sum_j \e^{i\q_\plll \R_{j\plll}}  \FD_{\si\sf}(\q_\plll,\v{T}_j).
\end{equation}
The elastic scattering cross section~\cref{Exsection} can be written as
\Emph{
\begin{equation}\label{Exsection2}
  \xElas
  = \sum_{jk} \e^{i\q_\plll(\R_{j\plll}-\R_{k\plll})}
         \FD_{\si\sf}(\q_\plll,\v{T}_j) \FD_{\si\sf}^*(\q_\plll,\v{T}_k).
\end{equation}
\vspace*{-5pt}}

In the following \Cref{SFormFactor} we discuss the form factor~$\FD_{\si\sf}$.
The remainder of this chapter is devoted to the
positional term and to the coupling between particle form and position;
various approximations are used to make~\cref{EsumRF} manageable.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Particle form factor}\label{SFormFactor}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\index{Particle!form factor|see {Form factor}}
\index{Form factor|(}

To compute the DWBA form factor
for a generic vertical wavefunction~$\phi(z)$,
it is advantageous to exchange the order of integration in~\cref{EcFdef}:
\begin{equation}\label{EcFx}
  \FD_{\si\sf}(\q_\plll,\v{T})
   = \int\!\d z\, \phi^*_\si(z) F(q_\plll,z,\v{T}) \phi_\sf(z).
\end{equation}
The function
\begin{equation}\label{EFqpadef}
  F(\q_\plll,z,\v{T})
  \coloneqq \int\!\d^2 r_\plll\, \e^{i\q_\plll \r_\plll} F(\r,\v{T})
\end{equation}
is an \E{intermediate Fourier transform},
since it is a transform in some, but not all the coordinates;
more specifically, it may be called the \E{horizontal Fourier transform}.
For homogeneous particles,
it is the \E{shape transform} of horizontal cuts.

For samples that only consist of homogeneous layers
the wavefunction is the sum of two plane waves~\cref{Ephizwj}.
With the notations~\cref{Eudef},
the DWBA form factor~\cref{EcFx} becomes
\begin{equation}\label{EcFres1}
  \FD_{\si\sf}(\q_\plll,\v{T})
   = \sum_l \sum_u C^u_l F_l(\q^u_l,\v{T})
\end{equation}
with
\begin{equation}\label{EFqTdef}
  F_l(\q,\v{T})
  \coloneqq \int\!\d z\, \e^{iq_\perp z} F(\q_\plll,z,\v{T}) \chi_l(z).
\end{equation}
Inserting~\cref{EFqpadef}, we find that this is a plain three-dimensional Fourier transform:
\begin{equation}\label{EFqT3d}
  F_l(\q,\v{T})
   = \int\!\d^3 r\, \e^{i\q \r} F(\r,\v{T})\chi_l(z).
\end{equation}
Except for the restriction to layer~$l$,
it is the standard form factor
that appears in the regular (plane-wave) Born approximation.
Therefore, it is occasionally called the \E{Born form factor},
and so we will call it.
\Cref{EcFres1,EFqTdef} remain applicable
if the plane waves~$\phi^\pm(z)$ are \E{damped} due to an imaginary part
of the refractive index.

\Work{Currently, the summation over~$l$ in~\cref{EcFres1} is not implemented in BornAgain.
Therefore particles must not extend beyond layer interfaces.
This restriction will be lifted in one of the next releases.}

To describe how~\cref{EFqT3d} is evaluated in BornAgain,
we need to specify some of the parameters contained in the generic parameter vector
$\v{T} \coloneqq (\Delta v_\sp,Z,\v{\Omega},\v{U})$:
$\Delta v_\sp$ is the SLD difference between the particle and the embedding matrix,
as discussed in~\cref{SAssX};
for an inhomogeneous particle, it is some reference value
obtained e.~g.\ from the maximum SLD.
$Z$ is the vertical location of the particle;
in our formalism, it is the vertical component of the position vector~$\R$.
$\v{\Omega}$ is a tuple of rotation angles;
they determine a rotation matrix~$D_{\v{\Omega}}$ that shall be defined by its action
\begin{equation}\label{ErOm}
  F(\r,\Delta v_\sp,Z,\v{\Omega},\v{U}) = F(D_{\v{\Omega}}^{-1}\r,\Delta v_\sp,Z,\v{0},\v{U}).
\end{equation}
Finally, $\v{U}$ collects all remaining parameters,
among them size and shape parameters that determine the geometry
and thereby the refractive index profile of the particle.
With this, we can express the generic Born form factor as
\begin{equation}\label{EqOm}
  F(\q,\Delta v_\sp,Z,\v{\Omega},\v{U}) = \Delta v_\sp \e^{iq_\plll Z} F(D_{\v{\Omega}}\q,\v{U}),
\end{equation}
introducing the standard form factor
\begin{equation}\label{EFqPdef}
  F(\q,\v{U}) \coloneqq F(\q,1,0,\v{0},\v{U}).
\end{equation}

BornAgain comes with a comprehensive library of form factors.
For general usage instructions, see~\Cref{SintroPFF}.
Hard-particle form factors are Fourier shape transforms.
They are available for various spheroids, cylinders, cones, prisms, and polyhedra,
as listed in~\Cref{SHPFF}.
Ripples, used to model gratings, are described in~\Cref{SRipple}.
Soft-particle form factors % TODO
are not yet documented in this Manual.

\section{Decoupling approximations}\label{Spartidis}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

In the DWBA matrix element~\cref{EsumRF},
particle positions, orientations, shapes, and sizes can be coupled in
arbitrary ways.
To proceed any further,
we need to specify this coupling at least in statistical terms.
This can in principle be done in two different ways:
Either through physical models, implemented within BornAgain,
or by loading a representative set $\{\R_i,\v{T}_i\}$
from an external \E{morphology} file
that could be generated from simulations,
or from electron microscopy images.

\index{Morphology!as input data}%
  is not yet implemented in \BornAgain,
  and not on our agenda.
  Please contact us if you have a use case.}

BornAgain provides various physical models
for the distribution of $\R_i$ and $\v{T}_i$.
Except if uniform particles form a perfect two-dimensional crystal,
some degrees of freedom will be more or less disordered.
Therefore the models need to be formulated in a statistical language.
That formalism is then versatile enough to also cover any degree of order.

To prepare a statistical formulation,
we encode the particle coordinates in a distribution function
\index{Distribution function!embedded particles}%
\index{Particle!distribution function}%
\index{Statistics!particle distribution}%
\begin{equation}\label{EPDdeltas}
  \PD(\r,\v\tau,\v\tau')
  \coloneqq \sum_{jk} \delta(\r-(\R_{j\plll}-\R_{k\plll}))
  \delta(\v\tau-\v{T}_j)\delta(\v\tau'-\v{T}_k).
\end{equation}
Its total integral is
\begin{equation}\label{EPint}
  \int\!\d^2r\, \int\! \d\v{\tau}\, \d\v{\tau}' \PD(\r,\v\tau,\v\tau')
  = N_p^2,
\end{equation}
where~$N_p$ is the number
\nomenclature[2n122 2p010]{$N_p$}{Number of scattering centers}%
of particles,
the integration over $\r$ is restricted to the horizontal plane,
and the differential $\d\v{\tau}$ is to be understood as $\d^n\tau$,
with $n$~being the dimensionality of~$\v\tau$.
In later approximations, \cref{EPint} will be a normalization requirement.
The differential cross section~\cref{Exsection2} can now be written as
\begin{equation}\label{Epdm1}
  \xElas
 =\int\!\d^2r\,   \e^{i\q_{\plll}\r}\!
  \int\! \d\v{\tau}\, \d\v{\tau}'
    \PD(\r,\v\tau,\v\tau')
    \FD(\v\tau) \FD^*(\v\tau'),
\end{equation}
In the following, we will present different physical models
that provide computable approximations
for the formally exact distribution~\cref{EPDdeltas}.

For the time being,
we only support models that make the following assumption
about the particle \E{properties} like shape, size, and orientation
(but \E{not} position) that are  encoded in the vector~$\v T_j$:
\Note{\textbf{T-T decoupling approximation:}
Properties of different particles are not correlated.}
\index{T-T decoupling approximation}%
In other words, the $\v T_j$
are independent and identically distributed (\E{i.i.d.}) random variables.
They all have the same distribution~$p(\v\tau)$.
Averages under this distribution shall be denoted as
\begin{equation}\label{Epavg}
  \bra f\ket \coloneqq  \int\!\d\v\tau\,p(\v\tau)f(\tau).
\end{equation}
Pairs of particles have the distribution~$p(\v\tau)p(\v\tau')$,
except if the two particles are identical.
In consequence, the distribution $\PD$ must have the form
\begin{equation}\label{EPbyG}
  \PD(\r,\v\tau,\v\tau')
  = N_p \{ \delta(\r)p(\v\tau)\delta(\v\tau-\v\tau')
           + \left[\GD(\r|\v\tau,\v\tau') - \delta(\r)\right] p(\v\tau)p(\v\tau')\}
\end{equation}
with the conditional position correlation function~$\GD$.
Inserting this in \cref{Epdm1} we obtain
\Emph
{\begin{equation}\label{EIdIc}
  \frac{1}{N_p}\xElas
  = I_\text{d}+I_\text{c}
\end{equation}\vskip -5pt}
with the \E{diffuse} and \E{coherent} scattering intensities
\index{Diffuse scattering}%
\index{Scattering!diffuse}%
\index{Coherent scattering}%
\index{Scattering!coherent}%
\Emph
{\begin{eqnarray}
  I_\text{d}\label{EIddef}
  &\coloneqq& \bra\left|\FD\right|^2\ket-\left|\bra\FD\ket\right|^2,
\\[2ex]
  I_\text{c}\label{EIcdef}
  &\coloneqq&
  \int\!\d^2r\,   \e^{i\q_{\plll}\r}\!
  \int\! \d\v{\tau}\, \d\v{\tau}'
  \GD(\r|\v\tau,\v\tau')p(\v\tau)p(\v\tau') \FD(\v\tau) \FD^*(\v\tau').
\end{eqnarray}\vskip -5pt}
The diffuse intensity can be rewritten as
\begin{equation}\label{EIdDiff}
  I_\text{d}
  = \bra\left|\FD-\bra\FD\ket\right|^2\ket,
\end{equation}
which shows that it is due to fluctuations of the single-particle form factor.

To proceed further,
we need to make approximations for the distribution~$\GD$.
Only a few paracrystal models actually specify
a conditioning of~$\GD$ on the particle properties~$\v\tau,\v\tau'$.
For all other models, we assume the
\Note{\textbf{R-T decoupling approximation:}
\index{R-T decoupling approximation}%
Particle positions do not depend on properties.}
Hence simply $\GD(\r|\v\tau,\v\tau')=\GD(\r)$.
To distinguish $\GD(\r)$ from the standard \E{pair correlation function}
\index{Pair correlation function}%
at atomic level, we will call it the
\E{particle position correlation function}.
\index{Particle!position correlation function}%
The Fourier transform
\begin{equation}\label{ESqdef}
  \SD(\q)
  \coloneqq \int\!\d^2r\, \e^{i\q_{\plll}\r}\! \GD(\r)
\end{equation}
shall be called the \E{interference function}.
\index{Interference function}%.
It is the two-dimensional, mesoscale equivalent of
the atomic \E{static structure factor}
\index{Static structure factor}%
(in crystallography also called \E{lattice factor}).
\index{Lattice factor}%
The coherent scattering intensity then takes the simple form
\Emph
{\begin{equation}\label{EIcFac}
  I_\text{c} = \SD(\q) \left|\bra\FD\ket\right|^2.
\end{equation}\vskip -5pt}
Together, the T-T and R-T decoupling
make up the \E{decoupling approximation}
\index{IsGISAXS@\IsGISAXS!decoupling approximation}
of \IsGISAXS.\footnote
{In the \IsGISAXS\ manual \cite[Sec.~2.2]{Laz08},
the \E{decoupling approximation} (DA)
\index{Decoupling approximation}%
\index{DA|see {Decoupling approximation}}%
is opposed to the
\E{local monodisperse approximation} (LMA)
\index{Local monodisperse approximation}%
\index{LMA|see {Local monodisperse approximation}}%
and the
\E{size-spacing correlation approximation} (SSCA).
\index{Size-spacing correlation approximation}%
\index{SSCA|see {Size-spacing correlation approximation}}%
We can now disentangle this skew trichotomy:
The LMA is opposite to coherent superposition;
it describes the incoherent average of
scattering from different coherence domains.
In \BornAgain,
it can be emulated by averaging over different simulated GISAS images
(as described in \cref{Scoherlen}),
or by attaching different \texttt{ParticleLayout}s to a \texttt{Layer}.
The SSCA is an alternative to the R-T decoupling approximation.
In \IsGISAXS, and similarly in \BornAgain,
it is only available for paracrystals
% TODO RESTORE TEMPORARILY REMOVED XREF
(to be documented later).
% and will therefore be discussed later (\cref{}).
}
In BornAgain, R-T decoupling is the default.
Only a few models explicitly introduce some size-position coupling.
The following sections are therefore mostly concerned with models for~$\SD(\q)$.

If a user-defined sample model leaves the interference function unspecified,
then the default (\texttt{InterferenceFunctionNone})
\index{InterferenceFunctionNone@\Code{InterferenceFunctionNone}}%
is simply $\SD(\q)=1$,
which is a valid model for \E{dilute} particles.
\index{Dilute particles}%
\index{Particle!dilute assembly}%
$I_\text{c}$ then cancels the second term in~\cref{EIddef},
so that the cross section~\cref{EIdIc} reduces to the incoherent sum
\begin{equation}\label{EIdInc}
  \frac{1}{N_p}\xElas
  = \bra\left|\FD\right|^2\ket
\end{equation}

By a \E{mesocrystal},
\index{Mesocrystal}%
\index{Crystal!mesoscopic|see{Mesocrystal}}%
we understand an assembly of \E{mesoscopic} particles
on a one- or two-dimensional lattice.
In BornAgain, we are nowhere concerned with
the usual three-dimensional, microscopic, atomistic crystals

\subsection{One-dimensional lattice} \label{sec:sect:1dlattice}
%===============================================================================

For a perfect one-dimensional lattice along the x-axis with period $a$, the position
correlation function is given by:
\begin{equation}
  \rho_S\GD(\r) = \sum_{n\neq 0} \delta(x-na)\delta(y).
\end{equation}
Using standard relations for the Dirac comb,
one obtains the interference function
\begin{equation}
 \SD(\q) = \frac{2\pi}{a}\sum_k \delta\left(q_x - \frac{2\pi k}{a}\right),
\end{equation}
which has the reciprocal lattice period $2\pi/a$.

For computational reasons in \BornAgain, the delta functions appearing in the interference function
are replaced by distributions of a finite width $H(q_x-2\pi k/a)$. This amounts to convoluting the
previously given interference function with $H(q_x)$ or, equivalently, multiplying
the position correlation function by the inverse Fourier image of $H(q_x)$, called the
\index{Decay function}
\E{decay function} $h(x)$.

The interference function can then be written as:
\begin{equation}
  \SD(q_x) = \frac{1}{a}\sum_k H\left(q_x - \frac{2\pi k}{a}\right).
\end{equation}

\BornAgain\ currently supports the following types of one-dimensional decay functions
(parameterized by a decay length $\lambda$):
\begin{equation}
  \begin{array}{|l|c|c|}
    \hline
    \text{Name} & h(x) & H(q_x) \\
    \hline
    \text{Cauchy} & \e^{-|x|/\lambda} & \frac{2\lambda}{1+q_x^2\lambda^2} \\
    \hline
    \text{Gauss} & \e^{-x^2/2\lambda^2} & \sqrt{2\pi}\lambda \e^{-q_x^2\lambda^2/2} \\
    \hline
    \text{Triangle} & 1-|x|/\lambda \quad \text{for} \quad |x|<\lambda & \lambda \sinc^2(q_x\lambda/2) \\
    \hline
  \end{array}
\end{equation}

In addition, a pseudo-Voigt decay function is available,
which is a convex combination of the Cauchy and Gauss decay functions.
\Emph{
The decay functions are all normalized such that $\int\!\d q_x H(q_x)=2\pi$,
which is equivalent to $h(0)=1$.
}
\Emph{
If the one-dimensional lattice is rotated with respect to the x-axis by an angle $\xi$,
the corresponding interference function is calculated
by using the correct projection of the in-plane reciprocal vector instead of $q_x$:
\begin{equation}
  q_\xi = q_x \cos\xi + q_y \sin\xi.
\end{equation}
}

%===============================================================================
\subsection{Two-dimensional lattice} \label{sec:sect:2dlattice}
%===============================================================================

For a perfect two-dimensional lattice with lattice basis $(\v a,\v b)$, the position
correlation function is given by:
\begin{equation}
  \rho_S\GD(\r) = \sum_{m,n} \delta(\r-m\v a - n\v b) - \delta(\r).
\end{equation}
The corresponding interference function then becomes
\begin{equation}
  \SD(\q) = 4\pi^2 \rho_S \sum_{\q_i\in\Lambda^*} \delta(\q - \q_i),
\end{equation}
where $\Lambda^*$ denotes the reciprocal lattice of $(\v a,\v b)$.

In \BornAgain, the two-dimensional delta functions need to be replaced again with
distributions of finite width $H(\q - \q_i)$. Currently, \BornAgain\ only allows for two-dimensional
decay functions that are defined in the radial variable
\begin{equation}
  \phi \coloneqq \sqrt{X^2/\lambda_X^2 + Y^2/\lambda_Y^2},
\end{equation}
where $(X,Y)$ are the coordinates in an orthonormal coordinate system,
where the $X$-axis is rotated
by an angle $\gamma$ with respect to the first lattice vector $\v a$.
This amounts to convoluting the
previously given interference function with $H(\q)$ or, equivalently, multiplying
the position correlation function by the inverse Fourier image of $H(\q)$, called the
\index{Decay function}
\E{decay function} $h(\phi)$.

The interference function can then be written as:
\begin{equation}
  \SD(\q) = \rho_S \sum_{\q_i\in\Lambda^*} H(\q - \q_i).
\end{equation}

\BornAgain\ currently supports the following types of two-dimensional decay functions
(parameterized by two decay lengths $\lambda_X, \lambda_Y$):
\begin{equation}
  \begin{array}{|l|c|c|}
    \hline
    \text{Name} & h(\phi) & H(Q) \\
    \hline
    \text{Cauchy} & \e^{-\phi} & \frac{2\pi\lambda_X\lambda_Y}{(1+Q^2)^{3/2}} \\
    \hline
    \text{Gauss} & \e^{-\phi^2/2} & 2\pi\lambda_X\lambda_Y \e^{-Q^2/2} \\
    \hline
  \end{array}
\end{equation}
with $Q \coloneqq \sqrt{q_X^2\lambda_X^2 + q_Y^2\lambda_Y^2}$.

In addition, a pseudo-Voigt decay function is available,
which is a convex combination of the Cauchy and Gauss decay functions.
\Emph{
The decay functions are all normalized such that $\int\!\d^2q_\plll H(\q)= 4\pi^2$,
which is equivalent to $h(0)=1$.

\section{Paracrystals}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%===============================================================================
\subsection{The one-dimensional paracrystal} \label{sec:sect:1dparacrystal}
%===============================================================================

A paracrystal, originally developed by Hosemann \cite{Hos51},
models the cumulative disorder of the interparticle distances.
Although the paracrystal in one dimension is not directly implemented in \BornAgain,
it forms the basis for the paracrystal models in \BornAgain\ and will thus be discussed first.

In one dimension, the paracrystal is parameterized by the
position distribution of the nearest neighbour $p(x)$, centered at a peak distance $D$.
The probablility
distribution of the position of the nearest neighbour to the right of the particle at the origin then becomes
\begin{equation}
  p_1(x) = p(x-D).
\end{equation}
The position distribution function for the next to nearest neighbour is then the convolution of this distribution with itself
(probability of finding the nearest neighbour at $x'$ times the probability of finding the next particle at distance $x-x'$ from the first and
then integrate over $x'$):
\begin{equation}
  p_2(x) = p(x-D) \otimes p(x-D).
\end{equation}
The probability distribution of finding a particle to the right of the particle at the origin then becomes:
\begin{equation}
  \rho_S \GD^+(x) = \sum_{n>0} \otimes^n p(x-D).
\end{equation}
The probability at the left side is just the mirror image: $\GD^-(x) = \GD^+(-x)$.
After taking the Fourier transform, the interference function is
\begin{equation}
  \SD(q_x) = 1 + 2\Re\left(\frac{P(q_x)}{1-P(q_x)}\right) = \Re\left(\frac{1+P(q_x)}{1-P(q_x)}\right),
\end{equation}
where $P(q_x)$ is the Fourier transform of $p(x-D)$.

Since the Fourier transformed distribution $P(q_x)$ will always be $1$ at $q_x=0$, there is a singularity at the origin of $\SD(q_x)$.
This singularity is caused by the forward scattering contribution of an infinitely long lattice and can be removed in two ways in \BornAgain.
The simplest way is to multiply $P(q_x)$ by a fixed factor that is very close, but not equal to, one:
\begin{equation}
  P'(q_x) \coloneqq P(q_x) \e^{-D/\Lambda},
\end{equation}
where $\Lambda$ has dimension of length and is called the damping length.

A second possibility for removing the singularity at $q_x=0$ consists of considering only a finite portion of the one-dimensional
paracrystal. Caution has to be taken here, since the probability distributions at either side of the particle will depend on which particle
of the finite lattice is considered. The calculations can still be carried out exactly and lead to the following expression for the
interference function:
\begin{equation}
   \SD(q_x) = 1 + 2\Re\left( \frac{P(q_x)}{1-P(q_x)} - \frac{P(q_x)\left[1-P^{N_p}(q_x)\right]}{N_p\left( 1 - P(q_x) \right)^2} \right),
\end{equation}
with $N_p$ the number of particles making up the finite lattice.

\Emph{
Before embarking on the paracrystal models, implemented in \BornAgain, it has to be stressed that there is no such thing as a
paracrystal in more than one dimension. The following models are consequently only to be seen as ad hoc approximations of lattices with
cumulative disorder.

%===============================================================================
\subsection{The radial paracrystal} \label{sec:sect:radialparacrystal}
%===============================================================================
In the radial paracrystal model, the interference function of the one-dimensional paracrystal is used directly, but applied to
the radial component of $\q_\plll$. The resulting interference function, which is radially symmetric, is then given by
\begin{equation}
  \SD(\q_\plll) =  \Re\left(\frac{1+P(q_\plll)}{1-P(q_\plll)}\right),
\end{equation}
or one of the versions with the singularity removed.

In \BornAgain, the following one-dimensional distribution functions for $p(x)$ are implemented:
\begin{equation}
  \begin{array}{|l|c|c|}
    \hline
    \text{Name} & p(x) & P(q_x) \\
    \hline
    \text{Cauchy} & \frac{1}{2\omega} \exp(-|x|/2\omega) & \frac{1}{1+q_x^2\omega^2} \\
    \hline
    \text{Gauss} & \frac{1}{\omega\sqrt{2\pi}} \exp(-x^2/2\omega^2) & \exp(-q_x^2\omega^2/2) \\
    \hline
    \text{Gate} & \frac{1}{2\omega}  \quad \text{for} \quad |x|<\omega & \sinc(q_x\omega) \\
    \hline
    \text{Triangle} & \frac{1}{\omega}\left(1 - |x|/\omega\right)  \quad \text{for} \quad |x|<\omega & \sinc^2(q_x \omega/2) \\
    \hline
    \text{Cosine} &  \frac{1}{2\omega}\left(1 + \cos(\pi x/\omega) \right)  \quad \text{for} \quad |x|<\omega & \frac{\sinc(q_x \omega)}{1-(q_x\omega/\pi)^2} \\
    \hline
  \end{array}
\end{equation}
In addition, a pseudo-Voigt distribution function is available, which is a convex combination of the Cauchy and Gauss distribution functions.

For the radial paracrystal, there is also an extension available in \BornAgain\ that takes into account a coupling between the size of the particles and
the inter-particle distance. This approximation is discussed in more detail in \ref{sec:sect:sscaparacrystal}.

%===============================================================================
\subsection{The two-dimensional paracrystal} \label{sec:sect:2dparacrystal}
%===============================================================================
The two-dimensional paracrystal model in \BornAgain\ is implemented as a simple convolution of the two one-dimensional paracrystals along the
lattice basis vectors. The calculation of the interference function results in a simple product of two one-dimensional interference functions:
\begin{equation}
  \SD(\q) =  \Re\left(\frac{1+P_1(\q)}{1-P_1(\q)}\right) \Re\left(\frac{1+P_2(\q)}{1-P_2(\q)}\right),
\end{equation}
where $P_1(\q)$ and $P_2(\q)$ denote the Fourier transforms of the two independent particle distributions (which are now both two-dimensional
distribution functions).

Again, \BornAgain\ provides for removing the singularity by either using a damping length or by indicating finite domain sizes.

The two-dimensional distributions supported in \BornAgain\ are parameterized by
\begin{equation}
  \phi \coloneqq \sqrt{X^2/\omega_X^2 + Y^2/\omega_Y^2},
\end{equation}
where $(X,Y)$ are the coordinates in an orthonormal coordinate system, where the $X$-axis is rotated
by an angle $\gamma$ with respect to the first lattice vector $\v a$.

The following distributions are currently supported:
\begin{equation}
  \begin{array}{|l|c|c|}
    \hline
    \text{Name} & p(\phi) & P(Q) \\
    \hline
    \text{Cauchy} & \frac{1}{2\pi\omega_X\omega_Y} \exp(-\phi) & \frac{1}{(1+Q^2)^{3/2}} \\
    \hline
    \text{Gauss} & \frac{1}{2\pi\omega_X\omega_Y} \exp(-\phi^2/2)  & \exp(-Q^2/2) \\
    \hline
    \text{Gate} & \frac{1}{\pi\omega_X\omega_Y}  \quad \text{for} \quad \phi < 1 & \frac{2J_1(Q)}{Q} \\
    \hline
    \text{Cone} & \frac{3}{\pi\omega_X\omega_Y}\left(1 - \phi \right)  \quad \text{for} \quad \phi < 1 & 6\left[ \frac{J_1(Q)}{Q} - \frac{1}{Q^3}\int_0^Q\!\d u u^2 J_0(u) \right] \\
    \hline
  \end{array}
\end{equation}
with $Q \coloneqq \sqrt{q_X^2\omega_X^2 + q_Y^2\omega_Y^2}$.

Again, a convex combination of the Cauchy and Gauss distributions in two dimensions is available (pseudo-Voigt).

%===============================================================================
\subsection{The radial paracrystal with size-position coupling} \label{sec:sect:sscaparacrystal}
%===============================================================================

Restricting the calculation to one layer, the differential cross section for a specific arrangement of particles of
different type is:
\begin{equation}
  \xElas
  =
  \sum_{ij}  \e^{i\q_{\plll}(\R_{j\plll}-\R_{i\plll})}\!
  \FD(\v{T}_i) \FD^*(\v{T}_j).
\end{equation}

In a statistical ensemble, this cross section has to be averaged by the joint probability density function
for all postions and types of each individual particle:
\begin{equation}
  \PD\left(\lbrace \R_{i\plll} \rbrace, \lbrace \v{T}_i \rbrace\right).
\end{equation}
Its normalization is chosen such that the total integral over its phase space equals $N!$,
with $N$ the number of particles. This reflects the arbitrary nature of the indices $i$ for each particle
and will be removed when we consider a specific choice for the indices.

The expectation value of the differential cross section then becomes
\begin{equation}\label{Ecsc}
  \left\langle\xElas\right\rangle
  =
  \frac{1}{N!}\,
  \int\!\prod_i\!d^2\R_{i\plll}\!d\v{T}_i
  \,\PD\left(\lbrace \R_{i\plll} \rbrace, \lbrace \v{T}_i \rbrace\right)
  \sum_{jk}  \e^{i\q_{\plll}(\R_{k\plll}-\R_{j\plll})}\!
  \FD(\v{T}_j) \FD^*(\v{T}_k).
\end{equation}

As for the case of the radial paracrystal, a one-dimensional approach is developed, which is then
applied to the radial component of the wavevector transfer. In this approach, we can replace the radial
postion $\R_{i\plll}$ with $x_i$.

For a one-dimensional arrangement of particles, we can choose the indices of the particles such that
they increase with their position $x_i$. If the joint probability density function is adapted to only
have support for particles ordered in this way, we can drop the factor $1/N!$ in the expectation value.

For each term appearing in the sum of the integrand of the expectation value of the cross section, we
only need to know the density function of the positions and types of two particles, denoted by their
indices $j$ and $k$. All other dependencies should be integrated out. In \cite{LeLa04}, this approach is
used to calculate the effects of different types of correlations between sizes and/or positions on
the diffuse scattering intensity. In \BornAgain\ only a specific case is implemented, namely
the one also appearing in the IsGisaxs software package as the \emph{size-spacing correlation
approximation} \cite{Laz08}.

In this case, the distribution of the inter-neighbor distance between two particles depends only on the
sizes of these two particles. Furthermore, the dependence is fixed to be a linear relationship of
the mean distance $d_n$ between particle $n-1$ and $n$ and the particles' sizes ($X(\v{T}_{n-1})$ and
$X(\v{T}_n)$):
\begin{equation}\label{Edm}
  \langle d_n \rangle
  =
  D + \kappa \left[ \Delta X(\v{T}_{n-1}) + \Delta X(\v{T}_{n}) \right],
\end{equation}
where $D$ is the average interparticle distance, $\kappa$ is the coupling parameter determining how
much this interparticle distance is influenced by the particles' sizes, and
\[ \Delta X(\v{T}_{n}) \coloneqq  X(\v{T}_{n}) - \langle X \rangle \]
is the deviation from the mean of the size of a particle of type $\v{T}_n$.

The differential cross section (\ref{Ecsc}) in this case can then be expressed as:
\begin{equation}\label{Ecsssca}
  \frac{1}{N}\left\langle\xElas\right\rangle
  =
  \int\!d\v{T}\,\PD (\v{T}) \left| \FD(\q,\v{T}) \right|^2
  +
  2\Re \left\lbrace \FD_\kappa(\q)\tilde{\FD}_\kappa(\q)
  \cdot
  \frac{P(q_\plll)}{1 - \tilde{p}_{2\kappa}(q_{\plll})P(q_\plll))} \right\rbrace ,
\end{equation}
with
\begin{align*}
  \tilde{p}_{\kappa}(q_\plll) & \coloneqq \int\!d\v{T}\,\PD (\v{T}) e^{i\kappa q_\plll\Delta X(\v{T})}, \\
  \FD_\kappa(\q) & \coloneqq \int\!d\v{T}\,\PD (\v{T}) e^{i\kappa q_\plll\Delta X(\v{T})} \FD(\q, \v{T}), \\
  \tilde{\FD}_\kappa(\q) & \coloneqq \int\!d\v{T}\,\PD (\v{T}) e^{i\kappa q_\plll\Delta X(\v{T})} \FD^*(\q, \v{T})
\end{align*}
and $P(q_\plll)$ is the Fourier transform of the average next neighbor distance (as was also the case for the radial
paracrystal).

The starting point for describing the interference of the scattering from different

The conditional interference function is defined as
\begin{equation}
  \SD(\q |\v\tau,\v\tau')

\subsection{Collection of particles} \label{sec:sect:interf}
%===============================================================================

Since in most experimental conditions only the statistical properties of the particles are known, one can consider the probabilistic value of this cross-section \idest its expectation value. Assuming that the particles' shapes are determined by their class $\alpha$, with the abundance ratio $p_\alpha \equiv N_\alpha / N$, and defining the particle density as $\rho_V \equiv N/V$, the expectation value becomes:
\begin{align*}
  \bra \xElas(\q) \ket  & = \sum_\alpha p_\alpha \left\lvert F_\alpha(\q)\right\rvert ^2 + \frac{\rho_V}{V}\sum_{\alpha,\beta} p_\alpha p_\beta F_\alpha (\q)F_\beta^*(\q)  \\
  & \times \iint_V d^3\v{R}_\alpha d^3\v{R}_\beta \ppcf{\alpha}{\beta}{R} \exp \left[ i\q\cdot (\v{R}_\alpha - \v{R}_\beta ) \right],
\end{align*}


where $\ppcf{\alpha}{\beta}{R}$ is called the \emph{partial pair correlation function}. It represents the normalized probability of finding particles of type $\alpha$ and $\beta$ in positions $\v{R}_\alpha$ and $\v{R}_\beta$ respectively.

TO MERGE IN:

\begin{align*}
  & \bra \xElas(\k_\si,\k_\sf) \ket_{\text{Off-specular}}  \\
  & = \sum_\alpha p_\alpha \left\lvert \curlf_\alpha(\k_{j,i},\k_{j,f}, R_{\alpha,z})\right\rvert ^2 + \frac{\rho_S}{S}\sum_{\alpha,\beta} p_\alpha p_\beta \curlf_\alpha (\k_{j,i},\k_{j,f}, R_{\alpha,z})\curlf_\beta^*(\k_{j,i},\k_{j,f}, R_{\beta,z}) \\

\end{align*}


TO MERGE IN:
This expression can be split into a diffuse part, which by definition should be zero for the case of only one particle type, and a coherent part, resulting from the coherent superposition of scattering amplitudes for particles at different positions:
\begin{equation*}
  \bra \xElas(\q) \ket
  = I_d(\q) + {\bra F_\alpha (\q ) S_{\alpha\beta} (\q) F_\beta^* (\q)
               \ket}_{\alpha\beta},
\end{equation*}
where
\begin{align*}
  I_d(\q) &
  \equiv {\bra\left\rvert F_\alpha (\q) \right\rvert^2\ket}_{\alpha}
       - \left\lvert {\bra F_\alpha (\q)\ket}_{\alpha} \right\rvert^2, \\
  S_{\alpha\beta} (\q) &\equiv 1 + \rho_V \int_V \d^3\r\mathcal{G}_{\alpha\beta}(\r)
                       \exp \left[ i\q\cdot \r \right].
\end{align*}
$S_{\alpha\beta} (\q)$ is called the \emph{interference function},
and $\bra\dotso\ket_\alpha$ is the expectation value over the classes $\lbrace \alpha\rbrace$.


TO MERGE IN:
More precisely, the probability density for finding a particle~$\alpha$
at position $\v{R}_\alpha$ and another one of type $\beta$ at $\v{R}_\beta$ is given by:

  \mathcal{P}(\alpha, \v{R}_\alpha ; \beta , \v{R}_\beta ) \equiv \rho_V^2 p_\alpha p_\beta \ppcf{\alpha}{\beta}{R}.
\end{equation*}

\section{Layout of particles}\label{sec:partlayout}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%===============================================================================
\subsection{The regular lattice and the ideal paracrystal}
%===============================================================================
The particles are positioned at regular intervals generating a layout characterized by its base vectors $\v{a}$ and $\v{b}$ (in direct space) and the angle between these two vectors.
This lattice can be two or one-dimensional depending on the characteristics of the particles. For example when they are infinitely long, the implementation can be simplified and reduced to a "pseudo" 1D system.

\index{Paracrystal}
A paracrystal, whose notion was developed by Hosemann \cite{Hos51},
allows fluctuations of the lengths and orientations of lattice vectors.
Paracrystals can be defined as distorted crystals
in which the crystalline order has not disappeared
and for which the behavior of the interference functions at small angles is coherent.
It is a transition between the regular lattice and the disordered state.\\

For example, in one dimension, a paracrystal is generated using the following method. First we place a particle at the origin. The second particle is put at a distance $x$ with a density probability $p(x)$ that is peaked at a mean value $D$: $\int_{-\infty} ^{\infty}p(x)\d x=1$
and $\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}xp(x)\d x=D$.
The third one is added at a distance $y$ from the second site
using the same rule with a density probability
$p_2(y)= \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}p(x)p(y-x)dx=p\otimes p(y)$.

With such a method, the pair correlation function $g(x)$ is built step by step.
Its expression and the one of its Fourier transform, which is the interference function are
\begin{equation*}
g(x)=\delta(x)+ p(x)+ p(x)\otimes p(x)+\ldots + p(-x)+\ldots \: \mathrm{and}\:\, S(q)=\Re\left(\dfrac{1+P(q)}{1-P(q)}\right),
\end{equation*}
 where $P(q)$ is the Fourier transform of the density probability $p(x)$.\\

\paragraph{Example} For a probability distribution function is Gaussian:
\begin{equation*}
p(x)=\frac{1}{\omega \sqrt{2\pi}} \exp\left(-\dfrac{(x-D)^2}{\omega^2}\right),\qquad P(q)=\exp\left(-\frac{q^2 \omega^2}{2}\right)\exp(iqD).
\end{equation*}
 The interference function of a one-dimensional paracrystal is given by

\begin{align*}
S(q) =\Re \left(\frac{1+\Phi(q) }{1 - \Phi(q)} \right), \quad \mathrm{where}\quad \Phi(q) = P(q)\exp\left(-\frac{D}{\Lambda}\right),
\end{align*}
where $\Lambda$ is a damping length used in order to introduce some finite-size effects.

\Cref{fig:1dparas_q} shows the evolution of $S(q)$ for different values of $\omega /D$.

\begin{figure}[tb]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{fig/funcplot/S_q_1Dparacrystal.eps}
\end{center}
\caption{Interference function of a 1D Gaussian paracrystal plotted for different values of $\omega /D$. The peaks broaden with a decreasing amplitude as $\omega/D$ increases. This shows the transition between an ordered and a disordered states. }
\label{fig:1dparas_q}
\end{figure}

In two dimensions, the paracrystal is constructed on a pseudo-regular lattice with base vectors $\v{a}$ and $\v{b}$ using the following conditions for the densities of probabilities:\\
$\int p_{\v{a}}(\r)\d^2r=\int p_{\v{b}}(\r)\d^2r=1$,
$\int \r p_{\v{a}}(\r)\d^2r=\v{a}$,
$\int \r p_{\v{b}}(\r)\d^2r=\v{b}$.

In the ideal case the deformations along the two axes are decoupled
and each unit cell should retain a parallelogram shape.
The interference function is given by
$S(q_{\plll})=\prod_{k=a,b}\Re\left(\dfrac{1+P_k(q_{\plll})}{1-P_k(q_{\plll})} \right)$
with $P_k$ the Fourier transform of $p_k$, $k=a, b$.

\paragraph{Probability distributions} \mbox{}\\
The scattering by an ordered lattice gives rise to a series of Bragg peaks situated at the nodes of the reciprocal lattice. Any divergence from the ideal crystalline case modifies the output spectrum by, for example, widening or attenuating the Bragg peaks. The influence of these "defects" can be accounted for
 in direct space by using correlation functions or by truncating the lattice or, in reciprocal space with structure factors or interference functions by convoluting the scattered peaks with a function which could reproduce the experimental shapes.

\subsection{Size-Spacing Correlation Approximation}
%===============================================================================
\index{Size-spacing correlation approximation}

TO MERGE IN:
introduces correlations between polydisperse particles, more precisely between the size of the particles and their mutual spacing. A classical example would consist in particles whose closest-neighbor spacing depends linearly on the sum of their respective sizes \cite{LaLR07}, as illustrated in \cref{fig:ssca}.

%For a sample where only the statistical properties of particle positions and size are known, the scattered intensity per scattering particle is expressed as the average over an ensemble of the Fourier transform of the Patterson function, which is the autocorrelation of the SLD $\curlp (\r ) \equiv \sum_{ij} S_i(-\r )\otimes S_j(\r )\otimes \delta (\r + \r_i - \r_j )$:
%\begin{equation*}
%  I(\q ) = \frac{1}{N}\ensavg{}{\curlf (\curlp (\r ))},
%\end{equation*}
%where $\curlf$ denotes the Fourier transform and $\curlp$ the Patterson function

\begin{figure}[tb]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{fig/drawing/drawingSSCA.pdf}
\end{center}
\caption{Sketch of a 1D distributed collection of particles, whose scattering could be described by the size-spacing correlation approximation: the distance between two particles depends on their sizes.}
\label{fig:ssca}
\end{figure}


In the Size-Spacing Correlation Approximation, a correlation is assumed between the shape/size of the particles and their mutual spacing. A classical example would consist of particles whose closest-neighbor spacing depends linearly on the sum of their respective sizes. The following discussion of this type of correlation is inspired by \cite{LaLR07}

The scattered intensity can also be calculated as the Fourier transform of the Patterson function, which is the autocorrelation of the SLD:
\begin{equation*}
  \curlp (\r ) \equiv \sum_{ij} S_i(-\r )\otimes S_j(\r )\otimes \delta (\r + \r_i - \r_j ).
\end{equation*}
For a sample where only the statistical properties of particle positions and shape/size are known, the scattered intensity per scattering particle becomes average over an ensemble of the Fourier transform of the Patterson function:
\begin{equation*}
  I(\q ) = \frac{1}{N}\bra\curlf (\curlp (\r ))\ket,
\end{equation*}
where $\curlf$ denotes the Fourier transform.

The ensemble averaged Patterson function will be denoted as:
\begin{equation*}
  Z(r) \equiv \frac{1}{N}\bra\curlp (\r )\ket.
\end{equation*}
In the case of systems where the particles are aligned in one dimension, this autocorrelation function can be further split into nearest neighbor probabilities. First, it is split into terms for negative, zero or positive distance:
\begin{equation*}
  Z(\r ) \equiv z_0(\r ) + z_+(\r ) + z_-(\r ).
\end{equation*}
Taking $x$ as the coordinate in the direction in which the particles are arranged and $s$ as an orthogonal coordinate ($\r \equiv (x,s)$), one obtains:
\begin{align*}
  z_0(\r ) &= \sum_{\alpha_0} p(\alpha_0) S_{\alpha_0}(-x,-s) \otimes S_{\alpha_0}(x,s)  \\
  z_+(\r ) &= \sum_{\alpha_0\alpha_1} p(\alpha_0,\alpha_1) S_{\alpha_0}(-x,-s) \otimes S_{\alpha_1}(x,s) \otimes P_1(x|\alpha_0\alpha_1)  \\
               &+ \sum_{\alpha_0\alpha_1\alpha_2} p(\alpha_0,\alpha_1,\alpha_2) S_{\alpha_0}(-x,-s) \otimes S_{\alpha_2}(x,s) \otimes P_1(x|\alpha_0\alpha_1) \otimes P_2(x|\alpha_0\alpha_1\alpha_2)  \\
               &+ \dotsb \\
  z_-(\r ) &= z_+(-\r ),
\end{align*}
where $p(\alpha_0,\dotsc ,\alpha_n)$ denotes the probability of having a sequence of particles of the indicated sizes/shapes and $P_n(x|\alpha_0\dotsc\alpha_n)$ is the probability density of having a particle of type $\alpha_n$ at a (positive) distance $x$ of its nearest neighbor of type $\alpha_{n-1}$ in a sequence of the given order.

In the Size-Spacing Correlation Approximation, one assumes that the particle sequence probabilities are just a product of their individual fractions:
\begin{equation*}
  p(\alpha_0,\dotsc ,\alpha_n) = \prod_i p(\alpha_i),
\end{equation*}
and the nearest neighbor distance distribution is dependent only on the two particles involved:
\begin{equation*}
  P_n(x|\alpha_0\dotsc\alpha_n) = P_1(x|\alpha_{n-1}\alpha_n).
\end{equation*}
Furthermore, the distance distribution $P_1(x|\alpha_0\alpha_1)$ depends on the particle sizes/shapes only through its mean value $D$:
\begin{equation*}
  P_1(x|\alpha_0\alpha_1) = P_0(x - D(\alpha_0,\alpha_1) ),
\end{equation*}
where $D(\alpha_0,\alpha_1) = D_0 + \kappa \left[ \Delta R(\alpha_0) + \Delta R(\alpha_1) \right]$, with $\Delta R(\alpha_i)$ the deviation of a size parameter of particle $i$ with respect to the mean over all particles sizes/shapes and $\kappa$ the coupling parameter.

In momentum space, the sum of convolutions can be written as a geometric series, which can be exactly calculated to be:
\begin{equation}
\label{Esscainf}
I(\q ) = {\bra\left| F_\alpha(\q ) \right| ^2\ket}_{\alpha}
+ 2 \Re \left\lbrace \widetilde{\curlf_\kappa}(\q )
 \widetilde{\curlf_\kappa^*}(\q ) \cdot
 \frac{\Omega_\kappa(\q )}{\tilde{p}_{2\kappa}(\q )\left
   [ 1 - \Omega_\kappa(\q )\right] } \right\rbrace,
\end{equation}
with
\begin{align*}
  \tilde{p}_\kappa(\q ) &= \int \d\alpha\; p(\alpha) \e^{i\kappa q_x \Delta R(\alpha)}  \\
  \Omega_\kappa(\q ) &= \tilde{p}_{2\kappa}(\q ) \phi(\q) \e^{i q_x D_0}  \\
  \widetilde{\curlf_\kappa}(\q ) &=
       \int \d\alpha\; p(\alpha)F_\alpha (\q ) \e^{i\kappa q_x \Delta R(\alpha)},
\end{align*}
and the Fourier transform of $P_1(x|\alpha_0\alpha_1)$ is
\begin{equation*}
  \curlp (\q ) = \phi (\q )\e^{i q_x D_0}
                    \e^{i \kappa q_x \left[ \Delta R(\alpha_0) + \Delta R(\alpha_1) \right] }.
\end{equation*}

Using the result from the one-dimensional analysis, one can apply this formula ad hoc for distributions of particles in a plane, where the coordinate $x$ will now be replaced with $(x,y)$, while the $s$ coordinate encodes a position in the remaining orthogonal direction. One must be aware however that this constitutes a further approximation, since this type of correlation does not have a general solution in more than one dimension.

The intensity in \cref{Esscainf} will contain a Dirac delta function contribution, caused by taking an infinite sum of terms that are perfectly correlated at $\q = 0$. One can leverage this behaviour by multiplying the nearest neighbor distribution by a constant factor $\e^{-D/\Lambda}$, which removes the division by zero in \cref{Esscainf}.
Another way of dealing with this infinity at $\q =0$ consists of taking only a finite number of terms, in which case the geometric series still has an analytic solution, but becomes a bit more cumbersome:
\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
  I(\q ) &= {\bra\left| F_\alpha(\q ) \right| ^2\ket}_\alpha
   + 2 \Re \Biggl\lbrace \frac{1}{\tilde{p}_{2\kappa}(\q )}\widetilde{\curlf_\kappa}(\q )\widetilde{\curlf_\kappa^*}(\q ) \\
  & \times \left[ \left( 1 - \frac{1}{N}\right) \frac{\Omega_\kappa(\q )}{1 - \Omega_\kappa(\q ) } - \frac{1}{N}\frac{\Omega_\kappa^2(\q )\left( 1- \Omega_\kappa^{N-1}(\q )\right) }{\left( 1 - \Omega_\kappa(\q ) \right) ^2 } \right] \Biggr\rbrace.
\end{split}
\end{equation*}
This expression has a well-defined limit for $\Omega_\kappa(\q ) \rightarrow 1$ (when $\q \rightarrow 0$), namely:
\begin{equation*}
  \lim_{\q \rightarrow 0} I(\q ) = {\bra\left| F_\alpha(0 ) \right| ^2\ket}_{\alpha} + \left( N-1 \right) \left| {\bra F_\alpha(0 )\ket}_{\alpha} \right|^2.
\end{equation*}

\subsection{Particles deposited on a substrate}
%===============================================================================
%Substrate modified Born approximation
In this configuration, the particles are sitting on top of a substrate layer in air or vacuum.
In the DWBA the expression of a form factor becomes
\begin{align}
F_{\rm{DWBA}}(q_{\plll}, k_{i,z}, k_{f,z}) &= F_{\rm{BA}}(q_{\plll}, k_{i,z}-k_{f,z})+ R_i F_{\rm{BA}}(q_{\plll}, -k_{i,z}-k_{f,z}) \nonumber \\
&+ R_f F_{\rm{BA}}(q_{\plll}, k_{i,z}+k_{f,z}) + R_i R_f F_{\rm{BA}}(q_{\plll},-k_{i,z}+k_{f,z}), \label{Edwbaair}
\end{align}
where $q_{\plll}$ is the component of the scattering beam in the plane of the interface ($\q=\k_i-\k_\sf$), $k_{i,z}$ and $k_{f,z}$ are the z-component of the incident and scattered beam, respectively. $R_i$, $R_f$ are the reflection coefficients in incidence and reflection. They are defined as\\ $R=\dfrac{k_z+\sqrt{n_s^2k_0^2-|k_{\plll}|^2}}{k_z-\sqrt{n_s^2 k_0^2-|k_{\plll}|^2}}$, where $n_s=1-\delta_s +i \beta_s$ is the refractive index of the substrate, $k_0$ is the wavelength in vacuum ($2\pi /\lambda$), $k_z$ and $k_{\plll}$ are the $z$-component and the in-plane component of $\k_\si$ or $\k_\sf$. \\

\Note{If the particles are sitting on a multilayered system, the expression of the form factor in the DWBA is obtained by replacing the Fresnel coefficient by the corresponding coefficients of the underlying layers \cite{Par54,BoWo99}.}

Script~\ref{lst:badwba} illustrates the difference between BA and DWBA in \BornAgain\ when generating the sample.  We consider the simple case of:
\begin{itemize}
\item one kind of particles' shape,
\item no interference between the particles,
\item in the DWBA, a sample made of a layer of substrate on which are deposited the particles,
\item in the BA, a sample composed of the particles in air.
\end{itemize}

%===============================================================================

The system considered in this section consists of particles encapsulated in a layer, which is sitting on a substrate. In this case the form factor in the DWBA is given by

\begin{align}
  F_{\rm{DWBA}}(q_{\plll}, k_{i,z}, k_{f,z})
  &= T_\si T_\sf F_{\rm{BA}}(q_{\plll}, k_{i,z}-k_{f,z})\e^{i(k_{i,z}-k_{f,z})d}\nonumber \\

  &+ R_\sf T_\si F_{\rm{BA}}(q_{\plll}, k_{i,z}+k_{f,z}) \e^{i(k_{i,z}+k_{f,z})d}\nonumber \\
  &+ R_\sf R_\si F_{\rm{BA}}(q_{\plll},-k_{i,z}+k_{f,z})\e^{i(-k_{i,z}+k_{f,z})d}, \label{Edwbaburied}
\end{align}

\begin{equation*}
R_j =\frac{t^{j}_{0,1}r^{j}_{1,2}\exp(2ik_{j,z}t)}{1+r^{j}_{0,1}r^{j}_{1,2}\exp(2ik_{j,z}t)}, \quad T_j=\frac{t^{j}_{0,1}}{1+r^{j}_{0,1}r^{j}_{1,2}\exp(2ik_{j,z}t)}, j=i,f
\end{equation*}
where $q_{\plll}$ is the component of the scattering beam in the plane of the interface, $k_{i,z}$ and $k_{f,z}$ are the z-component of the incident and scattered beams, respectively.  $d$ is the depth at which the particles are sitting in the layer. Note that this value is given relative to the top of this layer and it is not the coordinate in the absolute referential (linked with the full sample) and it is measured up to the bottom of the particle. $t$ is the thickness of the intermediate layer containing the particles. $R_{i,f}$ and $T_{i,f}$  are the reflection  and transmission coefficients in incidence and reflection (they can be calculated using Parratt or matrix formalism). $r^j_{0,1}$, $r^j_{1,2}$ $t^j_{0,1}$ are the reflection and transmission coefficients between layers; the indices are related to different boundaries with 0: air, 1: intermediate layer and 2: substrate layer and the superscript $j$ is associated with the incident or scattered beams:
\begin{equation*}
r^j_{n,n+1}=\frac{k_{j,z,n}-k_{j,z,n+1}}{k_{j,z,n}-k_{j,z,n+1}}, \qquad t^j_{n,n+1}= \frac{2k_{j,z,n}}{k_{j,z,n}-k_{j,z,n+1}}, \quad n=0,1, \quad j=i,f,
\end{equation*}
where index $n$ is related to the layers, $z$ to the vertical component, and $j$ to the beams (incident and outgoing).

\Note{For layers different from the air layer, the top interface is considered as the reference level to position the encapsulated particles.

This convention is different for the top air layer, where particles sitting at the interface with an underlying layer (\idest the bottom of the air layer) are located at depth 0 (see \cref{fig:depthpartBA}).}

\section{Implementation in \BornAgain}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

This section describes the implementation of the interference functions in \BornAgain.
For an implementation of all the components of a simulation,
the use is referred, for example, to \cref{sec:Example1Python}.\\


\Note{In \BornAgain\ the particles are positioned in the same vertical layer.}

\subsection{Size-distribution models}
\index{Size-distribution models}
The decoupling approximation (DA), local monodisperse approximation (LMA) and size spacing correlation approximation (SSCA) can be used in \BornAgain.
The selection between DA and SSCA is made using\\
\Code{ILayout.setApproximation(EInterferenceFunction approximation)} when defining the characteristics of the way particles and interference functions are embedded in a layer.  For example,
\begin{lstlisting}
    particle_layout = ParticleLayout()
   ....
# interference approx chosen between: DA (default) and SSCA
    particle_layout.setApproximation(ILayout.DA)
\end{lstlisting}

Note that with the SSCA, the users have to specify the coupling parameter $\kappa$ (with the function \Code{setKappa}), which should be a positive dimensionless value. $\kappa$ characterizes the influence of the neighboring particles' sizes on their distance. If $\kappa=0$, the SSCA reduces to the DA with a radial paracrystal for the interference function.\\

For the LMA, its implementation is automatically done when using more than one layout of particles:
\begin{lstlisting}
    particle_layout0 = ParticleLayout()
    particle_layout1 = ParticleLayout()
   ....
# association of each particles' layout with materials, form factors
#... and with a material layer
    layer_a = Layer(m_material_a)
    layer_a.addLayout(particle_layout0)
    layer_a.addLayout(particle_layout1)
\end{lstlisting}

%%ADD EXPLANATION ABOUT LMA

\subsection{Probability distribution functions}\label{baftd}
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The probability distribution functions have been implemented in the reciprocal space in \BornAgain. Their expressions are given in Table~\ref{table:pdf}.

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{ccc}
\hline
Function & One dimension & Two dimensions\\
\hline
Cauchy & $(1+q^2\omega^2)^{-3/2}$ & $(1 + q_x^2 cl_x^2 + q_y^2 cl_y^2)^{-3/2}$ \\
Gauss & $\dfrac{1}{2}\exp(-\dfrac{q^2\omega^2}{4})$ & $\frac{1}{2}\exp\left(-\dfrac{q_x^2 cl_x^2+ q_y^2cl_y^2}{4}\right)$ \\
Voigt & $\dfrac{\eta}{2} \exp\left(-\dfrac{q^2\omega^2}{4}\right) + \dfrac{1 - \eta}{(1 + q^2\omega^2)^{3/2}}$ & $\dfrac{\eta}{2} \exp\left(-\dfrac{q_x^2 cl_x^2+ q_y^2cl_y^2}{4}\right)+ \dfrac{1 - \eta}{(1 + q_x^2 cl_x^2+ q_y^2cl_y^2)^{3/2}}$ \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{List of probability distribution functions in reciprocal space. $\omega$, $cl$ stand for coherence lengths (the index refers to the axis) and  $\eta$ is a weighting coefficient.}
\label{table:pdf}
\end{table}

The Cauchy distribution corresponds to $\exp(-r)$ in real space and the Voigt one  is a linear combination of the Gaussian and Cauchy probability distribution functions.\\

\noindent \underline{One dimension}
\begin{itemize}
\item \Code{FTDistribution1DCauchy($\omega$)},
\item \Code{FTDistribution1DGauss($\omega$)},
\item \Code{FTDistribution1DVoigt($\omega, \eta$)}.
\end{itemize}
where $\omega$ is the coherence length and $\eta$ is a weighting factor.\\

\noindent \underline{Two dimensions}
\begin{itemize}
\item \Code{FTDistribution2DCauchy($cl_x$, $cl_y$)},
\item \Code{FTDistribution2DGauss($cl_x$, $cl_y$)},
\item \Code{FTDistribution2DVoigt($cl_x$, $cl_y$)}
\end{itemize}
where $cl_{x,y}$ are the coherence lengths in the $x$ or $y$ direction, respectively.

These functions can be used with all interference functions, except the case without any interference.

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Interferences}
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\index{Interference function}

The interference function is specified when building the sample. It is linked with the particles (shape, material). Examples of implementation are given at the end of each description.

\paragraph{Syntax:}
 \Code{particle\_layout.addInterferenceFunction(interference\_function)},\\ where \Code{particle\_layout} holds the information about the different shapes and their proportions for a given layer of particles, and \Code{interference\_function}  is one of the following expressions:
\begin{itemize}
\item \Code{InterferenceFunctionNone()}
\item \Code{InterferenceFunction1DLattice(lattice\_parameters)}
\item \Code{InterferenceFunctionRadialParaCrystal(peak\_distance, damping\_length)}
\item \Code{InterferenceFunction2DLattice(lattice\_parameters)}
\item \Code{InterferenceFunction2DParaCrystal(length\_1, length\_2, $\alpha$\_lattice, $\xi$, \\ damping\_length)}
\end{itemize}

\Note{\Code{InterferenceFunction1DLattice} can only be used for particles which are infinitely long in one direction of the sample's surface like for example a rectangular grating.}

\newpage
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{InterferenceFunctionNone}
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The particles are placed randomly in the dilute limit and are considered as individual, non-interacting scatterers. The scattered intensity is function of the form factors only.

\paragraph{Example} The sample is made of a substrate on which are deposited half-spheres. Script~\ref{lst:nointerf} details the commands necessary to generate such a sample. \Cref{fig:nointerf} shows an example of output intensity: Script~\ref{lst:nointerf}  + detector's + input beam's characterizations.

\Note{By default the long axis of the particles in this 1D lattice is along the beam axis. That is the reason why in the example below the particles are rotated by  $90^{\circ}$ in the $(x,y)$ plane: the main axis of the lattice is therefore parallel to the y-axis, perpendicular to the long axis of the particles.}

\vspace{12pt}
A probability distribution function \Code{pdf} has to be chosen from the list in \cref{baftd} in order to apply some modifications to the scattering peaks. This function is implemented using \Code{setProbabilityDistribution(pdf)}.

\paragraph{Example:} Script~\ref{lst:1dlattinterf} details how to build in  \BornAgain\ a sample using\\ \Code{InterferenceFunction1DLattice} as the interference function. As mentioned previously, this interference function can only be used with infinitely wide or long particles.\\ Here the sample is made of infinitely long boxes deposited on a substrate (these particles are characterized by their widths and heights). They are also rotated by $90^{\circ}$  in the sample surface in order to have their long axis perpendicular to the input beam, which is along the $x$-axis.\\
 The lattice parameters (the lattice length and angle between the lattice main axis and the $x$-axis) are passed into the constructor of the interference function.

\subsection{InterferenceFunction2DParaCrystal($L_1$, $L_2$, lattice\_angle, $xi$, damping\_length)} % TODO RESTORE \Code{}, \xi
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\begin{itemize}
\item[where] $L_1$, $L_2$ are the lengths of the lattice cell,
\item[] lattice\_angle the angle between the lattice basis vectors $\v{a}, \v{b}$ in direct space,
\item[] $\xi$ is the angle defining the lattice orientation (set to $0$ by default).
\item[] \Code{damping\_length} is used to introduce finite size effects by applying a multiplicative coefficient equal to  $\exp$(-\Code{peak\_distance/damping\_length}) to the Fourier transform of the probability densities. \Code{damping\_length} is equal to 0 by default and, in this case, no correction is applied.
\end{itemize}
Two predefined interference functions can also be used:
\begin{itemize}
\item  \Code{createSquare(peak\_distance, damping\_length, domain\_size\_1, domain\_size\_2)}\\
where the angle between the base vectors of the lattice is set to $\pi/2$,
it creates a squared lattice,
\item \Code{createHexagonal(peak\_distance, damping\_length, domain\_size\_1, domain\_size\_2)}\\
where the angle between the base vectors of the lattice is set to $2\pi/3$ ,
\end{itemize}
where
\Code{domain\_size1, 2} are the dimensions of coherent domains of the paracrystal along the main axes,\\ \Code{peak\_distance} is the same in both directions and $\v{a}\equiv \v{x}$.\\

Probability distribution functions have to be defined. As the two-dimensional paracrystal is defined from two independent one-dimensional paracrystals, we need two of these functions, using\\ \Code{setProbabilityDistributions(pdf\_1, pdf\_2)}, with \Code{pdf\_{1,2}} related to each main axis of the paracrystal (see \cref{fig:2dparaschematic}).

\includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{fig/drawing/drawing2Dparacrystal.pdf}

\caption{Schematics of the ideal 2D paracrystal. The gray-shaded areas mark the regions where the probability to find a node is larger that the width at half-maximum of the distribution. $L$ and  $W$ are the mean inter-node distances along the two crystallographic axes. cl$_{(L,W),(x,y)}$ are the widths of the distribution of distance. The disorder is propagated as we add more nodes. Such a structure would be generated using \Code{InterferenceFunction2DParacrystal(L,W,90.*degrees,0,damp\_length)}, with \Code{pdf$_1$ = FTDistribution2DGauss(cl$_{L,x}$,cl$_{L,y}$)} and  \Code{pdf$_2$ = FTDistribution2DGauss(cl$_{W,x}$,cl$_{W,y}$)}.}

\paragraph{Example} The particles deposited on a substrate are half-spheres. The scattered beams interference via the 2DParacrystal distribution function. The paracrystal is based on a 2D hexagonal lattice with a Gaussian probability distribution function in reciprocal space.  Script~\ref{lst:2dparainterf} shows the implementation of the interference function and \cref{fig:2ddl} an example of output intensity using hemi-spherical particles.
